## **A launchpad to the world, based in the Midwest**

Founded in 1820, Indiana University Bloomington is the flagship campus of IU’s seven campuses and two regional centers statewide. Its mission is to create, disseminate, preserve, and apply knowledge. It does so through its commitments to cutting-edge research, scholarship, arts, and creative activity; to challenging and inspired undergraduate, graduate, professional, and lifelong education; to culturally diverse and international educational programs and communities; to first-rate library and museum collections; to economic development in the state and region; and to meaningful experiences outside the classroom.

| In 2018, IU launched University Collections, part of a sustained effort to ensure that all of IU’s collections are properly preserved, housed, and made accessible to all members of the IU community, the general public, and scholars everywhere. The Collections center provides all collections with access to share resources, provide training opportunities, and assist in creating necessary plans and policies to ensure the safety and longevity of all collections. | The IU Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies was established in 2012 and named in 2018. Offering the most foreign languages in the country, the HLS provide students with a superior global education, including the #1 fellowships and language Flagship programs in the country. The Hamilton Lugar School combines the study of history, culture, society, and language with a close examination of pressing global issues. |
